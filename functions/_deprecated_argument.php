/**
 * Mark a function argument as deprecated and inform when it has been used.
 *
 * This function is to be used whenever a deprecated function argument is used.
 * Before this function is called, the argument must be checked for whether it was
 * used by comparing it to its default value or evaluating whether it is empty.
 * For example:
 *
 *     if ( ! empty( $deprecated ) ) {
 *         _deprecated_argument( __FUNCTION__, '3.0.0' );
 *     }
 *
 *
 * There is a hook deprecated_argument_run that will be called that can be used
 * to get the backtrace up to what file and function used the deprecated
 * argument.
 *
 * The current behavior is to trigger a user error if WP_DEBUG is true.
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 * @access private
 *
 * @param string $function The function that was called.
 * @param string $version  The version of WordPress that deprecated the argument used.
 * @param string $message  Optional. A message regarding the change. Default null.
