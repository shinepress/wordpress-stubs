 * are dummy gettext calls to get them into the POT file and this function
 * properly translates them back.
 *
 * The before_last_bar() call is needed, because older installs keep the roles
 * using the old context format: 'Role name|User role' and just skipping the
 * content after the last bar is easier than fixing them in the DB. New installs
 * won't suffer from that problem.
 *
 * @since 2.8.0
 *
 * @param string $name The role name.
 * @return string Translated role name on success, original name on failure.
