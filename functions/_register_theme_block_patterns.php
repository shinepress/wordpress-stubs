/**
 * Register any patterns that the active theme may provide under its

 *
 *     /**
 *      * Title: My Pattern
 *      * Slug: my-theme/my-pattern
 *      *
 *
 * The output of the PHP source corresponds to the content of the pattern, e.g.:
 *
 *     <main><p><?php echo "Hello"; ?></p></main>
 *
 * If applicable, this will collect from both parent and child theme.
 *
 * Other settable fields include:
 *
 *   - Description
 *   - Viewport Width
 *   - Categories       (comma-separated values)
 *   - Keywords         (comma-separated values)
 *   - Block Types      (comma-separated values)
