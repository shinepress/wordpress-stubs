/**
 * Build an object with all post type capabilities out of a post type object
 *
 * Post type capabilities use the 'capability_type' argument as a base, if the
 * capability is not set in the 'capabilities' argument array or if the
 * 'capabilities' argument is not supplied.
 *
 * The capability_type argument can optionally be registered as an array, with
 * the first value being singular and the second plural, e.g. array('story, 'stories')
 * Otherwise, an 's' will be added to the value for the plural form. After
 * registration, capability_type will always be a string of the singular value.
 *
 * By default, seven keys are accepted as part of the capabilities array:
 *
 * - edit_post, read_post, and delete_post are meta capabilities, which are then
 *   generally mapped to corresponding primitive capabilities depending on the
 *   context, which would be the post being edited/read/deleted and the user or
 *   role being checked. Thus these capabilities would generally not be granted
 *   directly to users or roles.
 *
 * - edit_posts - Controls whether objects of this post type can be edited.
 * - edit_others_posts - Controls whether objects of this type owned by other users
 *   can be edited. If the post type does not support an author, then this will
 *   behave like edit_posts.
 * - publish_posts - Controls publishing objects of this post type.
 * - read_private_posts - Controls whether private objects can be read.
 *
 * These four primitive capabilities are checked in core in various locations.
 * There are also seven other primitive capabilities which are not referenced
 * directly in core, except in map_meta_cap(), which takes the three aforementioned
 * meta capabilities and translates them into one or more primitive capabilities
 * that must then be checked against the user or role, depending on the context.
 *
 * - read - Controls whether objects of this post type can be read.
 * - delete_posts - Controls whether objects of this post type can be deleted.
 * - delete_private_posts - Controls whether private objects can be deleted.
 * - delete_published_posts - Controls whether published objects can be deleted.
 * - delete_others_posts - Controls whether objects owned by other users can be
 *   can be deleted. If the post type does not support an author, then this will
 *   behave like delete_posts.
 * - edit_private_posts - Controls whether private objects can be edited.
 * - edit_published_posts - Controls whether published objects can be edited.
 *
 * These additional capabilities are only used in map_meta_cap(). Thus, they are
 * only assigned by default if the post type is registered with the 'map_meta_cap'
 * argument set to true (default is false).
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @see register_post_type()
 * @see map_meta_cap()
 *
 * @param object $args Post type registration arguments.
 * @return object object with all the capabilities as member variables.
