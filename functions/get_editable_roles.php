 * Simple function who's main purpose is to allow filtering of the

 * inappropriate ones depending on the situation or user making edits.
 * Specifically because without filtering anyone with the edit_users
 * capability can edit others to be administrators, even if they are
 * only editors or authors. This filter allows admins to delegate
 * user management.
