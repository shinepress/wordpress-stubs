/**
 * Preloads old Requests classes and interfaces.
 *
 * This function preloads the old Requests code into memory before the
 * upgrade process deletes the files. Why? Requests code is loaded into
 * memory via an autoloader, meaning when a class or interface is needed
 * If a request is in process, Requests could attempt to access code. If
 * the file is not there, a fatal error could occur. If the file was
 * replaced, the new code is not compatible with the old, resulting in
 * a fatal error. Preloading ensures the code is in memory before the
 * code is updated.
 *
 * @since 6.2.0
 *
 * @global string[]           $_old_requests_files Requests files to be preloaded.
 * @global WP_Filesystem_Base $wp_filesystem       WordPress filesystem subclass.
 * @global string             $wp_version          The WordPress version string.
 *
 * @param string $to Path to old WordPress installation.
