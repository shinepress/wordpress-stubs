 * Add a new option for a given blog id.

 * resources can not be serialized or added as an option.
 *
 * You can create options without values and then update the values later.
 * Existing options will not be updated and checks are performed to ensure that you
 * aren't adding a protected WordPress option. Care should be taken to not name
 * options the same as the ones which are protected.

 * @param mixed  $value  Optional. Option value, can be anything. Expected to not be SQL-escaped.
 * @return bool False if option was not added and true if option was added.
