 * Reset internal cache keys and structures.
 *
 * If the cache back end uses global blog or site IDs as part of its cache keys,
 * this function instructs the back end to reset those keys and perform any cleanup
 * since blog or site IDs have changed since cache init.
 *
 * This function is deprecated. Use wp_cache_switch_to_blog() instead of this
 * function when preparing the cache for a blog switch. For clearing the cache
 * during unit tests, consider using wp_cache_init(). wp_cache_init() is not
 * recommended outside of unit tests as the performance penalty for using it is
 * high.
