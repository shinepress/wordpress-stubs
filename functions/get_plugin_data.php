/**
 * Parses the plugin contents to retrieve plugin's metadata.
 *
 * The metadata of the plugin's data searches for the following in the plugin's
 * header. All plugin data must be on its own line. For plugin description, it
 * must not have any newlines or only parts of the description will be displayed
 * and the same goes for the plugin data. The below is formatted for printing.
 *
 *     /*
 *     Plugin Name: Name of Plugin
 *     Plugin URI: Link to plugin information
 *     Description: Plugin Description
 *     Author: Plugin author's name
 *     Author URI: Link to the author's web site
 *     Version: Must be set in the plugin for WordPress 2.3+
 *     Text Domain: Optional. Unique identifier, should be same as the one used in
 *          load_plugin_textdomain()
 *     Domain Path: Optional. Only useful if the translations are located in a
 *          folder above the plugin's base path. For example, if .mo files are
 *          located in the locale folder then Domain Path will be "/locale/" and
 *          must have the first slash. Defaults to the base folder the plugin is
 *          located in.
 *     Network: Optional. Specify "Network: true" to require that a plugin is activated
 *          across all sites in an installation. This will prevent a plugin from being
 *          activated on a single site when Multisite is enabled.
 *      * / # Remove the space to close comment
 *
 * Some users have issues with opening large files and manipulating the contents
 * for want is usually the first 1kiB or 2kiB. This function stops pulling in
 * the plugin contents when it has all of the required plugin data.
 *
 * The first 8kiB of the file will be pulled in and if the plugin data is not
 * within that first 8kiB, then the plugin author should correct their plugin
 * and move the plugin data headers to the top.
 *
 * The plugin file is assumed to have permissions to allow for scripts to read
 * the file. This is not checked however and the file is only opened for
 * reading.
 *
 * @since 1.5.0
