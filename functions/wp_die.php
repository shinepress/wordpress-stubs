/**
 * Kill WordPress execution and display HTML message with error message.
 *
 * This function complements the `die()` PHP function. The difference is that
 * HTML will be displayed to the user. It is recommended to use this function
 * only when the execution should not continue any further. It is not recommended
 * to call this function very often, and try to handle as many errors as possible
 * silently or more gracefully.
 *
 * As a shorthand, the desired HTTP response code may be passed as an integer to
 * the `$title` parameter (the default title would apply) or the `$args` parameter.
 *
 * @since 2.0.4
 * @since 4.1.0 The `$title` and `$args` parameters were changed to optionally accept
 *              an integer to be used as the response code.
 *
 * @param string|WP_Error  $message Optional. Error message. If this is a WP_Error object,
 *                                  and not an Ajax or XML-RPC request, the error's messages are used.
 *                                  Default empty.
 * @param string|int       $title   Optional. Error title. If `$message` is a `WP_Error` object,
 *                                  error data with the key 'title' may be used to specify the title.
 *                                  If `$title` is an integer, then it is treated as the response
 *                                  code. Default empty.
 * @param string|array|int $args {
 *     Optional. Arguments to control behavior. If `$args` is an integer, then it is treated
 *     as the response code. Default empty array.
 *
 *     @type int    $response       The HTTP response code. Default 200 for Ajax requests, 500 otherwise.
 *     @type bool   $back_link      Whether to include a link to go back. Default false.
 *     @type string $text_direction The text direction. This is only useful internally, when WordPress
 *                                  is still loading and the site's locale is not set up yet. Accepts 'rtl'.
 *                                  Default is the value of is_rtl().
 * }
