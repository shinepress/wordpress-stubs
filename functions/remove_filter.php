 * This function removes a function attached to a specified filter hook. This
 * method can be used to remove default functions attached to a specific filter
 * hook and possibly replace them with a substitute.
 *
 * To remove a hook, the $function_to_remove and $priority arguments must match
 * when the hook was added. This goes for both filters and actions. No warning
 * will be given on removal failure.
 *
 * @since 1.2.0
 *
 * @global WP_Hook[] $wp_filter Stores all of the filters and actions.
 *
 * @param string   $tag                The filter hook to which the function to be removed is hooked.
 * @param callable $function_to_remove The name of the function which should be removed.
 * @param int      $priority           Optional. The priority of the function. Default 10.
 * @return bool    Whether the function existed before it was removed.
