 * The default content type is `text/plain` which does not allow using HTML.
 * However, you can set the content type of the email by using the
 * {@see 'wp_mail_content_type'} filter.

 * The default charset is based on the charset used on the blog. The charset can
 * be set using the {@see 'wp_mail_charset'} filter.
