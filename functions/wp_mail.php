/**
 * Send mail, similar to PHP's mail
 *
 * A true return value does not automatically mean that the user received the
 * email successfully. It just only means that the method used was able to
 * process the request without any errors.
 *
 * Using the two 'wp_mail_from' and 'wp_mail_from_name' hooks allow from
 * creating a from address like 'Name <email@address.com>' when both are set. If
 * just 'wp_mail_from' is set, then just the email address will be used with no
 * name.
 *
 * The default content type is 'text/plain' which does not allow using HTML.
 * However, you can set the content type of the email by using the
 * {@see 'wp_mail_content_type'} filter.
 *
 * The default charset is based on the charset used on the blog. The charset can
 * be set using the {@see 'wp_mail_charset'} filter.
 *
 * @since 1.2.1

 * @param string       $subject     Email subject
 * @param string       $message     Message contents
 * @param string|array $headers     Optional. Additional headers.
 * @param string|array $attachments Optional. Files to attach.
 * @return bool Whether the email contents were sent successfully.
