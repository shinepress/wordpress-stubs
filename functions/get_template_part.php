 * Load a template part into a template
 *
 * Makes it easy for a theme to reuse sections of code in a easy to overload way
 * for child themes.
 *
 * Includes the named template part for a theme or if a name is specified then a
 * specialised part will be included. If the theme contains no {slug}.php file
 * then no template will be included.
 *
 * The template is included using require, not require_once, so you may include the
 * same template part multiple times.
 *
 * For the $name parameter, if the file is called "{slug}-special.php" then specify
 * "special".
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @param string $slug The slug name for the generic template.
 * @param string $name The name of the specialised template.
