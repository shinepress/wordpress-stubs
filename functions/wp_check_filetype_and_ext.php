 * Attempt to determine the real file type of a file.

 * If unable to, the file name extension will be used to determine type.
 *
 * If it's determined that the extension does not match the file's real type,
 * then the "proper_filename" value will be set with a proper filename and extension.
 *
 * Currently this function only supports renaming images validated via wp_get_image_mime().
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @param string $file     Full path to the file.
 * @param string $filename The name of the file (may differ from $file due to $file being
 *                         in a tmp directory).
 * @param array   $mimes   Optional. Key is the file extension with value as the mime type.
 * @return array Values for the extension, MIME, and either a corrected filename or false
 *               if original $filename is valid.
