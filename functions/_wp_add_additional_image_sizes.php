 * Adds additional default image sub-sizes.
 *
 * These sizes are meant to enhance the way WordPress displays images on the front-end on larger,
 * high-density devices. They make it possible to generate more suitable `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
 * when the users upload large images.
 *
 * The sizes can be changed or removed by themes and plugins but that is not recommended.
 * The size "names" reflect the image dimensions, so changing the sizes would be quite misleading.
