/**
 * Add an endpoint, like /trackback/.
 *
 * Adding an endpoint creates extra rewrite rules for each of the matching
 * places specified by the provided bitmask. For example:
 *
 *     add_rewrite_endpoint( 'json', EP_PERMALINK | EP_PAGES );
 *
 * will add a new rewrite rule ending with "json(/(.*))?/?$" for every permastruct
 * that describes a permalink (post) or page. This is rewritten to "json=$match"
 * where $match is the part of the URL matched by the endpoint regex (e.g. "foo" in
 * "[permalink]/json/foo/").
 *
 * A new query var with the same name as the endpoint will also be created.
 *
 * When specifying $places ensure that you are using the EP_* constants (or a
 * combination of them using the bitwise OR operator) as their values are not
 * guaranteed to remain static (especially `EP_ALL`).
 *
 * Be sure to flush the rewrite rules - see flush_rewrite_rules() - when your plugin gets
 * activated and deactivated.
 *
 * @since 2.1.0
 * @since 4.3.0 Added support for skipping query var registration by passing `false` to `$query_var`.
 *
 * @global WP_Rewrite $wp_rewrite WordPress rewrite component.
 *
 * @param string      $name      Name of the endpoint.
 * @param int         $places    Endpoint mask describing the places the endpoint should be added.
 * @param string|bool $query_var Name of the corresponding query variable. Pass `false` to skip registering a query_var
 *                               for this endpoint. Defaults to the value of `$name`.
