/**
 * Retrieves the classes for the post div as an array.
 *
 * The class names are many. If the post is a sticky, then the 'sticky'
 * class name. The class 'hentry' is always added to each post. If the post has a
 * post thumbnail, 'has-post-thumbnail' is added as a class. For each taxonomy that
 * the post belongs to, a class will be added of the format '{$taxonomy}-{$slug}' -
 * eg 'category-foo' or 'my_custom_taxonomy-bar'.
 *
 * The 'post_tag' taxonomy is a special
 * case; the class has the 'tag-' prefix instead of 'post_tag-'. All classes are
 * passed through the filter, {@see 'post_class'}, with the list of classes, followed by
 * $class parameter value, with the post ID as the last parameter.
 *
 * @since 2.7.0
 * @since 4.2.0 Custom taxonomy classes were added.
 *
 * @param string|array $class   One or more classes to add to the class list.
 * @param int|WP_Post  $post_id Optional. Post ID or post object.
 * @return array Array of classes.
