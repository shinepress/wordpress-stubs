/**
 * Get the post title.
 *
 * The post title is fetched and if it is blank then a default string is
 * returned.
 *
 * Copied from `wp-admin/includes/template.php`, but we can't include that
 * file because:
 *
 * 1. It causes bugs with test fixture generation and strange Docker 255 error
 *    codes.
 * 2. It's in the admin; ideally we *shouldn't* be including files from the
 *    admin for a block's output. It's a very small/simple function as well,
 *    so duplicating it isn't too terrible.
 *
 * @since 3.3.0
 *
 * @param int|WP_Post $post Optional. Post ID or WP_Post object. Default is global $post.
 * @return string The post title if set; "(no title)" if no title is set.
