 * Retrieves attached file path based on attachment ID.

 * By default the path will go through the 'get_attached_file' filter, but
 * passing a true to the $unfiltered argument of get_attached_file() will
 * return the file path unfiltered.
 *
 * The function works by getting the single post meta name, named
 * '_wp_attached_file' and returning it. This is a convenience function to
 * prevent looking up the meta name and provide a mechanism for sending the
 * attached filename through a filter.
 *
 * @since 2.0.0
 *
 * @param int  $attachment_id Attachment ID.
 * @param bool $unfiltered    Optional. Whether to apply filters. Default false.
 * @return string|false The file path to where the attached file should be, false otherwise.
