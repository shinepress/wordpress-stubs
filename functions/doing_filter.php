/**
 * Retrieve the name of a filter currently being processed.

 * The function current_filter() only returns the most recent filter or action

 * processed.
 *
 * This function allows detection for any filter currently being
 * executed (despite not being the most recent filter to fire, in the case of
 * hooks called from hook callbacks) to be verified.
 *
 * @since 3.9.0
 *
 * @see current_filter()
 * @see did_action()
 * @global array $wp_current_filter Current filter.
 *
 * @param null|string $filter Optional. Filter to check. Defaults to null, which
 *                            checks if any filter is currently being run.
 * @return bool Whether the filter is currently in the stack.
