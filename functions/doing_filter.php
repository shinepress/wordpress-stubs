 * This function allows detection for any filter currently being executed
 * (regardless of whether it's the most recent filter to fire, in the case of
 * hooks called from hook callbacks) to be verified.
 *
 * @since 3.9.0
 *
 * @see current_filter()
 * @see did_action()
 * @global string[] $wp_current_filter Current filter.
 *
 * @param null|string $hook_name Optional. Filter hook to check. Defaults to null,
 *                               which checks if any filter is currently being run.
 * @return bool Whether the filter is currently in the stack.
