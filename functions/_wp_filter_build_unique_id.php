/**
 * Builds Unique ID for storage and retrieval.
 *
 * The old way to serialize the callback caused issues and this function is the
 * solution. It works by checking for objects and creating a new property in
 * the class to keep track of the object and new objects of the same class that
 * need to be added.
 *
 * It also allows for the removal of actions and filters for objects after they
 * change class properties. It is possible to include the property $wp_filter_id
 * in your class and set it to "null" or a number to bypass the workaround.
 * However this will prevent you from adding new classes and any new classes
 * will overwrite the previous hook by the same class.
 *
 * Functions and static method callbacks are just returned as strings and
 * shouldn't have any speed penalty.
 *
 * @link https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3875
 *
 * @since 2.2.3
 * @since 5.3.0 Removed workarounds for spl_object_hash().
 *              `$hook_name` and `$priority` are no longer used,
 *              and the function always returns a string.
 *
 * @access private
 *
 * @param string                $hook_name Unused. The name of the filter to build ID for.
 * @param callable|string|array $callback  The callback to generate ID for. The callback may
 *                                         or may not exist.
 * @param int                   $priority  Unused. The order in which the functions
 *                                         associated with a particular action are executed.
 * @return string Unique function ID for usage as array key.
