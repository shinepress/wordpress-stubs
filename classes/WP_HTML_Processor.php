/**
 * HTML API: WP_HTML_Processor class
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage HTML-API
 * @since 6.4.0
 */
/**
 * Core class used to safely parse and modify an HTML document.
 *
 * The HTML Processor class properly parses and modifies HTML5 documents.
 *
 * It supports a subset of the HTML5 specification, and when it encounters
 * unsupported markup, it aborts early to avoid unintentionally breaking
 * the document. The HTML Processor should never break an HTML document.
 *
 * While the `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor` is a valuable tool for modifying
 * attributes on individual HTML tags, the HTML Processor is more capable
 * and useful for the following operations:
 *
 *  - Querying based on nested HTML structure.
 *
 * Eventually the HTML Processor will also support:
 *  - Wrapping a tag in surrounding HTML.
 *  - Unwrapping a tag by removing its parent.
 *  - Inserting and removing nodes.
 *  - Reading and changing inner content.
 *  - Navigating up or around HTML structure.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Use of this class requires three steps:
 *
 *   1. Call a static creator method with your input HTML document.
 *   2. Find the location in the document you are looking for.
 *   3. Request changes to the document at that location.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     $processor = WP_HTML_Processor::create_fragment( $html );
 *     if ( $processor->next_tag( array( 'breadcrumbs' => array( 'DIV', 'FIGURE', 'IMG' ) ) ) ) {
 *         $processor->add_class( 'responsive-image' );
 *     }
 *
 * #### Breadcrumbs
 *
 * Breadcrumbs represent the stack of open elements from the root
 * of the document or fragment down to the currently-matched node,
 * if one is currently selected. Call WP_HTML_Processor::get_breadcrumbs()
 * to inspect the breadcrumbs for a matched tag.
 *
 * Breadcrumbs can specify nested HTML structure and are equivalent
 * to a CSS selector comprising tag names separated by the child
 * combinator, such as "DIV > FIGURE > IMG".
 *
 * Since all elements find themselves inside a full HTML document
 * when parsed, the return value from `get_breadcrumbs()` will always
 * contain any implicit outermost elements. For example, when parsing
 * with `create_fragment()` in the `BODY` context (the default), any
 * tag in the given HTML document will contain `array( 'HTML', 'BODY', â€¦ )`
 * in its breadcrumbs.
 *
 * Despite containing the implied outermost elements in their breadcrumbs,
 * tags may be found with the shortest-matching breadcrumb query. That is,
 * `array( 'IMG' )` matches all IMG elements and `array( 'P', 'IMG' )`
 * matches all IMG elements directly inside a P element. To ensure that no
 * partial matches erroneously match it's possible to specify in a query
 * the full breadcrumb match all the way down from the root HTML element.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     $html = '<figure><img><figcaption>A <em>lovely</em> day outside</figcaption></figure>';
 *     //               ----- Matches here.
 *     $processor->next_tag( array( 'breadcrumbs' => array( 'FIGURE', 'IMG' ) ) );
 *
 *     $html = '<figure><img><figcaption>A <em>lovely</em> day outside</figcaption></figure>';
 *     //                                  ---- Matches here.
 *     $processor->next_tag( array( 'breadcrumbs' => array( 'FIGURE', 'FIGCAPTION', 'EM' ) ) );
 *
 *     $html = '<div><img></div><img>';
 *     //                       ----- Matches here, because IMG must be a direct child of the implicit BODY.
 *     $processor->next_tag( array( 'breadcrumbs' => array( 'BODY', 'IMG' ) ) );
 *
 * ## HTML Support
 *
 * This class implements a small part of the HTML5 specification.
 * It's designed to operate within its support and abort early whenever
 * encountering circumstances it can't properly handle. This is
 * the principle way in which this class remains as simple as possible
 * without cutting corners and breaking compliance.
 *
 * ### Supported elements
 *
 * If any unsupported element appears in the HTML input the HTML Processor
 * will abort early and stop all processing. This draconian measure ensures
 * that the HTML Processor won't break any HTML it doesn't fully understand.
 *
 * The following list specifies the HTML tags that _are_ supported:
 *
 *  - Containers: ADDRESS, BLOCKQUOTE, DETAILS, DIALOG, DIV, FOOTER, HEADER, MAIN, MENU, SPAN, SUMMARY.
 *  - Custom elements: All custom elements are supported. :)
 *  - Form elements: BUTTON, DATALIST, FIELDSET, INPUT, LABEL, LEGEND, METER, PROGRESS, SEARCH.
 *  - Formatting elements: B, BIG, CODE, EM, FONT, I, PRE, SMALL, STRIKE, STRONG, TT, U, WBR.
 *  - Heading elements: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, HGROUP.
 *  - Links: A.
 *  - Lists: DD, DL, DT, LI, OL, UL.
 *  - Media elements: AUDIO, CANVAS, EMBED, FIGCAPTION, FIGURE, IMG, MAP, PICTURE, SOURCE, TRACK, VIDEO.
 *  - Paragraph: BR, P.
 *  - Phrasing elements: ABBR, AREA, BDI, BDO, CITE, DATA, DEL, DFN, INS, MARK, OUTPUT, Q, SAMP, SUB, SUP, TIME, VAR.
 *  - Sectioning elements: ARTICLE, ASIDE, HR, NAV, SECTION.
 *  - Templating elements: SLOT.
 *  - Text decoration: RUBY.
 *  - Deprecated elements: ACRONYM, BLINK, CENTER, DIR, ISINDEX, KEYGEN, LISTING, MULTICOL, NEXTID, PARAM, SPACER.
 *
 * ### Supported markup
 *
 * Some kinds of non-normative HTML involve reconstruction of formatting elements and
 * re-parenting of mis-nested elements. For example, a DIV tag found inside a TABLE
 * may in fact belong _before_ the table in the DOM. If the HTML Processor encounters
 * such a case it will stop processing.
 *
 * The following list specifies HTML markup that _is_ supported:
 *
 *  - Markup involving only those tags listed above.
 *  - Fully-balanced and non-overlapping tags.
 *  - HTML with unexpected tag closers.
 *  - Some unbalanced or overlapping tags.
 *  - P tags after unclosed P tags.
 *  - BUTTON tags after unclosed BUTTON tags.
 *  - A tags after unclosed A tags that don't involve any active formatting elements.
