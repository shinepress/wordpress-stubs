/**
 * Core class used to safely parse and modify an HTML document.
 *
 * The HTML Processor class properly parses and modifies HTML5 documents.
 *
 * It supports a subset of the HTML5 specification, and when it encounters
 * unsupported markup, it aborts early to avoid unintentionally breaking
 * the document. The HTML Processor should never break an HTML document.
 *
 * While the `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor` is a valuable tool for modifying
 * attributes on individual HTML tags, the HTML Processor is more capable
 * and useful for the following operations:
 *
 *  - Querying based on nested HTML structure.
 *
 * Eventually the HTML Processor will also support:
 *  - Wrapping a tag in surrounding HTML.
 *  - Unwrapping a tag by removing its parent.
 *  - Inserting and removing nodes.
 *  - Reading and changing inner content.
 *  - Navigating up or around HTML structure.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Use of this class requires three steps:
 *
 *   1. Call a static creator method with your input HTML document.
 *   2. Find the location in the document you are looking for.
 *   3. Request changes to the document at that location.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     $processor = WP_HTML_Processor::create_fragment( $html );
 *     if ( $processor->next_tag( array( 'breadcrumbs' => array( 'DIV', 'FIGURE', 'IMG' ) ) ) ) {
 *         $processor->add_class( 'responsive-image' );
 *     }
 *
 * #### Breadcrumbs
 *
 * Breadcrumbs represent the stack of open elements from the root
 * of the document or fragment down to the currently-matched node,
 * if one is currently selected. Call WP_HTML_Processor::get_breadcrumbs()
 * to inspect the breadcrumbs for a matched tag.
 *
 * Breadcrumbs can specify nested HTML structure and are equivalent
 * to a CSS selector comprising tag names separated by the child
 * combinator, such as "DIV > FIGURE > IMG".
 *
 * Since all elements find themselves inside a full HTML document
 * when parsed, the return value from `get_breadcrumbs()` will always
 * contain any implicit outermost elements. For example, when parsing
 * with `create_fragment()` in the `BODY` context (the default), any
 * tag in the given HTML document will contain `array( 'HTML', 'BODY', â€¦ )`
 * in its breadcrumbs.
 *
 * Despite containing the implied outermost elements in their breadcrumbs,
 * tags may be found with the shortest-matching breadcrumb query. That is,
 * `array( 'IMG' )` matches all IMG elements and `array( 'P', 'IMG' )`
 * matches all IMG elements directly inside a P element. To ensure that no
 * partial matches erroneously match it's possible to specify in a query
 * the full breadcrumb match all the way down from the root HTML element.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     $html = '<figure><img><figcaption>A <em>lovely</em> day outside</figcaption></figure>';
 *     //               ----- Matches here.
 *     $processor->next_tag( array( 'breadcrumbs' => array( 'FIGURE', 'IMG' ) ) );
 *
 *     $html = '<figure><img><figcaption>A <em>lovely</em> day outside</figcaption></figure>';
 *     //                                  ---- Matches here.
 *     $processor->next_tag( array( 'breadcrumbs' => array( 'FIGURE', 'FIGCAPTION', 'EM' ) ) );
 *
 *     $html = '<div><img></div><img>';
 *     //                       ----- Matches here, because IMG must be a direct child of the implicit BODY.
 *     $processor->next_tag( array( 'breadcrumbs' => array( 'BODY', 'IMG' ) ) );
 *
 * ## HTML Support
 *
 * This class implements a small part of the HTML5 specification.
 * It's designed to operate within its support and abort early whenever
 * encountering circumstances it can't properly handle. This is
 * the principle way in which this class remains as simple as possible
 * without cutting corners and breaking compliance.
 *
 * ### Supported elements
 *
 * If any unsupported element appears in the HTML input the HTML Processor
 * will abort early and stop all processing. This draconian measure ensures
 * that the HTML Processor won't break any HTML it doesn't fully understand.
 *
 * The HTML Processor supports all elements other than a specific set:
 *
 *  - Any element inside a TABLE.
 *  - Any element inside foreign content, including SVG and MATH.
 *  - Any element outside the IN BODY insertion mode, e.g. doctype declarations, meta, links.
 *
 * ### Supported markup
 *
 * Some kinds of non-normative HTML involve reconstruction of formatting elements and
 * re-parenting of mis-nested elements. For example, a DIV tag found inside a TABLE
 * may in fact belong _before_ the table in the DOM. If the HTML Processor encounters
 * such a case it will stop processing.
 *
 * The following list illustrates some common examples of unexpected HTML inputs that
 * the HTML Processor properly parses and represents:
 *
 *  - HTML with optional tags omitted, e.g. `<p>one<p>two`.
 *  - HTML with unexpected tag closers, e.g. `<p>one </span> more</p>`.
 *  - Non-void tags with self-closing flag, e.g. `<div/>the DIV is still open.</div>`.
 *  - Heading elements which close open heading elements of another level, e.g. `<h1>Closed by </h2>`.
 *  - Elements containing text that looks like other tags but isn't, e.g. `<title>The <img> is plaintext</title>`.
 *  - SCRIPT and STYLE tags containing text that looks like HTML but isn't, e.g. `<script>document.write('<p>Hi</p>');</script>`.
 *  - SCRIPT content which has been escaped, e.g. `<script><!-- document.write('<script>console.log("hi")</script>') --></script>`.
 *
 * ### Unsupported Features
 *
 * This parser does not report parse errors.
 *
 * Normally, when additional HTML or BODY tags are encountered in a document, if there
 * are any additional attributes on them that aren't found on the previous elements,
 * the existing HTML and BODY elements adopt those missing attribute values. This
 * parser does not add those additional attributes.
 *
 * In certain situations, elements are moved to a different part of the document in
 * a process called "adoption" and "fostering." Because the nodes move to a location
 * in the document that the parser had already processed, this parser does not support
 * these situations and will bail.
